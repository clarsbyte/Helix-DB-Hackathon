    "summary": "This document introduces the fundamental concepts of vectors, including their geometric representation, magnitude, and direction. It details how to perform vector addition, scalar multiplication, find component forms, and determine unit vectors. Furthermore, it covers operations with vectors expressed in terms of i and j, the calculation of the dot product, and the identification of orthogonal vectors, concluding with a real-world application of ground speed and bearing.",
